                Aidan Jiang's life started in Year 9 as he didn't exists before then, source; Trust me. His life started in China when he worked as a Jordan 4's Shoe slave for the hit company 'Temu'. Jiang also has 3 kids, whom are hidden from the media as he struggles to pay for his 3 kids and child support but his job at <a href="https://captainbens.tuckerfox.co.nz"><strong>Captian Ben's Fish and Chip's</strong></a> is whats helping him support his whole family. Aidan is very heavily influenced through his affinity for cartel drug dealing in 1992, where he used his fake watch store as a drug front for his money laungering scheme. While he has kids he is horrible with women, unable to find a women for two whole years even if he thinks otherwise. <br>
                On the volleyball court, Aidan found another arena to channel his energy and competitive spirit. As a middle blocker, he thrived on the intensity of the game, his strategic mind and quick reflexes making him a formidable presence. He embraced the teamwork, the challenge, and the satisfying impact of the ball. <br>
                Though his story is just beginning, Aidan's life is already rich with music, academic pursuits, athletic endeavors, and a hint of youthful rebellion. His journey, though newly written, promises a future filled with the same vibrant energy, dedication, and the pursuit of his passions that have defined his initial steps.
